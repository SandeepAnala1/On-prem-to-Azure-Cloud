# Notes for On-premises to Azure Cloud Migration

## Lookups
- Identify all lookup operations in your on-premises system.
- Translate these lookup operations into appropriate Azure services or mechanisms, such as Azure SQL Database for relational data or Azure Blob Storage for unstructured data.
- Ensure proper data synchronization and connectivity between on-premises systems and Azure services.

## Dynamic Content
- Review all dynamic content generation in your existing on-premises processes.
- Adapt these dynamic content generation mechanisms to utilize Azure services for scalability and flexibility.
- Leverage Azure Functions or Logic Apps for dynamic content generation as per your requirements.

## Stored Procedures
- Extract stored procedures from your on-premises databases.
- Migrate these stored procedures to Azure SQL Database or Azure SQL Managed Instance.
- Ensure compatibility and optimize performance for Azure SQL services.

## Inserting New Data
- Analyze the process of inserting new data into your on-premises systems.
- Modify data insertion processes to integrate with Azure services such as Azure Data Factory for batch data loading or Azure Event Hubs for real-time data ingestion.
- Ensure data consistency and integrity during the migration process.

## Watermark Columns
- Identify watermark columns used for tracking data changes in your on-premises databases.
- Implement similar watermarking mechanisms in Azure services, such as Azure Data Factory or Azure Databricks, to track incremental data changes during migration.
- Ensure proper handling of watermark columns to maintain data integrity and consistency in the cloud environment.

## For Each Activity
- Evaluate existing "For Each" activities or loops in your on-premises data processing workflows.
- Refactor these activities to utilize Azure Data Factory's "ForEach" activity or Azure Functions for parallel processing in the cloud environment.
- Optimize data processing workflows for scalability and performance in Azure.

## Metadata-Driven Pipeline
- Identify metadata-driven aspects of your on-premises data pipelines, such as configuration files or database tables containing pipeline configurations.
- Design metadata-driven pipelines using Azure Data Factory or Azure Logic Apps to dynamically configure and orchestrate data workflows based on metadata.
- Ensure flexibility and maintainability by decoupling pipeline logic from specific data sources or destinations.

These notes provide a high-level overview of considerations and strategies for migrating various components of on-premises data workflows to the Azure Cloud. Each topic requires detailed analysis and planning to ensure a successful migration with minimal disruption to business operations.
